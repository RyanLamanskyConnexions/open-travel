## Connexions Open Travel

This repository contains code that can be used as a reference for implementation of the Connexions travel API (CAPI).

## Building and Running

To fully build and run this code, you need the following tools:

* Node.js 6.9.5 or higher; older versions may work but are not tested.
* Visual Studio 2017 for Windows is the only tested platform.  Older versions of Visual Studio (such as 2015) will not work.  Visual Studio for Mac and Visual Studio Code *may* work but are not tested.
* Windows 7 or higher for the ASP.NET Core "Kestrel" web server.  Windows 8 or higher for IIS or IIS Express.

There are no known dependencies on extra extensions for Visual Studio; it should work with a clean installation.

The free Community Edition of Visual Studio is worth considering if you are on a team of 6 or less, or make your contributions available as open source.
 
## Hosting Requirements

Windows Server 2012 or higher.
Linux and macOS may work as this code is built using .NET Standard and .NET Core, which do not have any intrinsic Windows dependencies.
